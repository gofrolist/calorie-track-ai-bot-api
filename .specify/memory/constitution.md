# Calorie Track AI Bot Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-First Nutrition Analysis
Every meal analysis leverages computer vision and AI to provide accurate calorie and macro estimates; Photo analysis must be reliable, fast, and provide detailed nutritional breakdown; User feedback loop continuously improves model accuracy

### II. Telegram Bot Excellence
Bot interface must be intuitive and responsive; Commands and interactions follow Telegram UX best practices; Error handling provides clear, actionable feedback; Bot scales gracefully with user growth

### III. API-First Architecture
Backend follows RESTful API design principles; OpenAPI specifications drive development; All endpoints are versioned and backward-compatible; Clear separation between bot logic and core services

### IV. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced; Both unit and integration tests required for all features

### V. Observability & Monitoring
Comprehensive structured logging with correlation IDs across all components; Centralized log aggregation and analysis; Metrics and tracing for performance monitoring; Health checks and alerting for critical systems; AI model inference performance tracking; User experience analytics and feedback loops

### VI. Internationalization & Accessibility
Multi-language support for global user base; i18n implementation for both bot and web app; Cultural adaptation for nutrition data and recommendations; Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) for inclusive design; Right-to-left language support; Localized date/time and number formatting

### VII. Modern UI/UX Excellence
Design system following modern mobile-first principles; Intuitive user flows with minimal cognitive load; Progressive disclosure of complex features; Consistent visual hierarchy and typography; Micro-interactions and smooth animations; Dark/light theme support; Responsive design across all device sizes

### VIII. Feature Flag Management
All features must implement feature flags for dynamic enable/disable control; Feature flags support user-level, group-level, and global toggles; A/B testing capabilities for gradual feature rollouts; Emergency feature disabling without deployment; Feature flag analytics and usage tracking; Configuration management for feature flags across environments

### IX. Data Protection & Privacy
All user data complies with GDPR/CCPA and local regulations; Data encryption in transit and at rest; User consent for data use is mandatory; Privacy by design principles; Data minimization and purpose limitation; Right to data portability and deletion; Regular privacy impact assessments; Secure data handling procedures
