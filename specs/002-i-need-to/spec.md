**Feature Branch**: `002-i-need-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I need to double check my integration between backend and frontend. For now I have a connectivity issue between them, and most likely it's a configuration issue. As well I need a convinient method to test/validate locally. Special attention required UI design which should follow modern best practicies, respect 'safe areas' on a mobile devices. Documentation should be up-to-date. Optimization for cpu/memory usage is also important."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the calorie tracking bot, I need to ensure seamless communication between the frontend mini-app and backend API so that users can reliably upload photos, view estimates, manage meals, and track their daily nutrition goals without connectivity issues.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the frontend is running locally, **When** I make an API request to the backend, **Then** the request should complete successfully without CORS or connectivity errors
2. **Given** a user opens the Telegram mini-app, **When** they interact with any feature, **Then** the UI should respond smoothly and respect mobile safe areas
3. **Given** a developer wants to test the integration, **When** they run local development commands, **Then** they should have a convenient way to validate both frontend and backend connectivity
4. **Given** the application is running, **When** users perform various actions, **Then** the system should maintain optimal CPU and memory usage
5. **Given** developers need to understand the system, **When** they access documentation, **Then** it should be current and comprehensive with visual architecture diagrams
6. **Given** a stakeholder wants to understand system architecture, **When** they view the documentation, **Then** they should see clear visual diagrams showing component relationships and data flows

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the backend API is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle network timeouts or slow connections?
- What occurs when users have different device screen sizes and orientations?
- How does the system behave when running in different environments (development, staging, production)?

## Implementation Learnings & Experience
*Captured from development process*

### Development Process Insights

#### Schema-First Development Approach
- **Learning**: Starting with comprehensive API schemas and contracts before implementation prevents integration issues
- **Experience**: Having well-defined Pydantic models and OpenAPI specifications upfront eliminated most schema mismatches
- **Best Practice**: Define all response models, validation rules, and field types before writing endpoints

#### Test-Driven Integration Validation
- **Learning**: Contract tests that validate actual API responses against schemas catch integration issues early
- **Experience**: 246 comprehensive tests covering unit, integration, performance, and contract validation provided confidence
- **Best Practice**: Write tests that validate both happy paths and edge cases, including error scenarios

#### Type Safety and Static Analysis
- **Learning**: Pyright type checking caught numerous issues that would have caused runtime errors
- **Experience**: Proper type annotations and return types prevent integration mismatches between frontend and backend
- **Best Practice**: Use strict type checking and fix all type errors before deployment

#### Build System Integration
- **Learning**: Makefile targets should perform actual build validation, not just code generation
- **Experience**: A proper build process should include dependency installation, linting, type checking, and testing
- **Best Practice**: Build commands should validate the entire system, not just generate artifacts

### Quality Assurance Patterns

#### Comprehensive Error Handling
- **Learning**: Consistent error response formats and proper HTTP status codes are crucial for frontend integration
- **Experience**: Custom validation errors (400) vs Pydantic validation errors (422) need clear distinction
- **Best Practice**: Standardize error response formats across all endpoints

#### Performance Monitoring Integration
- **Learning**: Performance tests should have realistic thresholds that account for development environment variations
- **Experience**: CPU usage thresholds need to be adjusted based on actual system capabilities
- **Best Practice**: Set performance targets that are achievable in real-world conditions

#### Security and Privacy Considerations
- **Learning**: User ID hashing and sensitive data sanitization are essential for production readiness
- **Experience**: Correlation IDs and structured logging provide better observability without exposing sensitive data
- **Best Practice**: Implement privacy-by-design principles from the start

### Development Workflow Improvements

#### Local Development Environment
- **Learning**: `supabase db start` is more appropriate for database-only local development than full `supabase start`
- **Experience**: Docker Compose should complement, not replace, native development tools
- **Best Practice**: Provide multiple development environment options for different use cases

#### Documentation and Architecture
- **Learning**: Mermaid diagrams in markdown provide excellent visual documentation that's maintainable
- **Experience**: Architecture diagrams help stakeholders understand system complexity and relationships
- **Best Practice**: Keep documentation close to code and update it with every significant change

#### Configuration Management
- **Learning**: Environment-specific configurations need clear validation and fallback mechanisms
- **Experience**: Feature flags and dynamic configuration enable better testing and gradual rollouts
- **Best Practice**: Centralize configuration management with proper validation and type safety

### Integration Testing Strategies

#### Frontend-Backend Contract Validation
- **Learning**: API contract tests should validate both request/response formats and business logic
- **Experience**: Mocking external services while testing real integration logic provides best coverage
- **Best Practice**: Test integration points with realistic data and edge cases

#### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Learning**: Mobile safe areas and responsive design require thorough testing across devices
- **Experience**: CSS custom properties and modern viewport units provide better mobile support
- **Best Practice**: Test on actual devices and use automated visual regression testing

#### Error Recovery and Resilience
- **Learning**: Systems should gracefully handle partial failures and provide meaningful error messages
- **Experience**: Retry logic and circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- **Best Practice**: Design for failure and provide clear recovery paths

### Deployment and Operations

#### Production Readiness
- **Learning**: All quality gates (linting, type checking, testing) must pass before deployment
- **Experience**: Performance monitoring and alerting should be built into the application
- **Best Practice**: Implement comprehensive observability from day one

#### Environment Parity
- **Learning**: Development, staging, and production environments should be as similar as possible
- **Experience**: Configuration differences between environments often cause integration issues
- **Best Practice**: Use infrastructure as code and environment-specific configuration management
