# Feature Specification: Backend-Frontend Integration & Modern UI/UX Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-need-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I need to double check my integration between backend and frontend. For now I have a connectivity issue between them, and most likely it's a configuration issue. As well I need a convinient method to test/validate locally. Special attention required UI design which should follow modern best practicies, respect 'safe areas' on a mobile devices. Documentation should be up-to-date. Optimization for cpu/memory usage is also important."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the calorie tracking bot, I need to ensure seamless communication between the frontend mini-app and backend API so that users can reliably upload photos, view estimates, manage meals, and track their daily nutrition goals without connectivity issues.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the frontend is running locally, **When** I make an API request to the backend, **Then** the request should complete successfully without CORS or connectivity errors
2. **Given** a user opens the Telegram mini-app, **When** they interact with any feature, **Then** the UI should respond smoothly and respect mobile safe areas
3. **Given** a developer wants to test the integration, **When** they run local development commands, **Then** they should have a convenient way to validate both frontend and backend connectivity
4. **Given** the application is running, **When** users perform various actions, **Then** the system should maintain optimal CPU and memory usage
5. **Given** developers need to understand the system, **When** they access documentation, **Then** it should be current and comprehensive with visual architecture diagrams
6. **Given** a stakeholder wants to understand system architecture, **When** they view the documentation, **Then** they should see clear visual diagrams showing component relationships and data flows

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the backend API is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle network timeouts or slow connections?
- What occurs when users have different device screen sizes and orientations?
- How does the system behave when running in different environments (development, staging, production)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST establish reliable communication between frontend and backend without CORS errors
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a convenient local testing method for developers to validate integration
- **FR-003**: Frontend MUST respect mobile safe areas and adapt to different screen sizes
- **FR-004**: System MUST follow Modern UI/UX Excellence principles for mobile-first design
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain optimal CPU and memory usage during normal operations (<512MB RAM peak, <80% CPU sustained)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide up-to-date documentation for all integration points
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle network connectivity issues gracefully with appropriate error messages
- **FR-008**: System MUST support local development and production environment configurations
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide real-time feedback for API connectivity status
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide comprehensive architecture diagrams using markdown or code-based drawing tools
- **FR-012**: System MUST document all system components and their interactions visually
- **FR-013**: System MUST include data flow diagrams showing how information moves through the system
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide deployment architecture diagrams for local development and production environments

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **API Configuration**: Represents the connection settings and endpoints between frontend and backend
- **Environment Settings**: Represents different deployment configurations (development, production)
- **UI Components**: Represents the visual elements that need to respect mobile safe areas and Modern UI/UX Excellence principles
- **Performance Metrics**: Represents the CPU and memory usage data that needs to be optimized
- **Documentation**: Represents the technical documentation that needs to be kept current
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Represents visual documentation of system components, data flows, and deployment structures
