# Feature Specification: Telegram Food Photo Nutrition Analyzer

**Feature Branch**: `001-description-i-am`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I'm building a telegram bot which will analyze users photos of food and provide information about how many calories and proteins/fat/carbohydrates it containts. logs this information and provide detailed statiscs of consumed calories to help to follow diets and etc. The bot itself should me minimalistic, just send a picture and get an information about calories in response. All other details available in mini-app. Design should be modern and responsive (mobile in priority). Use these templates for a baseline @https://github.com/telegram-mini-apps"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (Telegram user), actions (send photo, view stats, correct entries), data (nutrition estimates, daily totals), constraints (minimal bot UX, modern mobile-first Mini App)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a person tracking nutrition, I want to send a food photo to a Telegram bot and immediately receive an estimated calorie and macronutrient breakdown so that I can quickly log my meal and see my daily progress in a modern, mobile-first Mini App.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given I am chatting with the bot, When I send a clear photo of a single dish, Then I receive an automated reply that includes total calories and a proteins/fats/carbohydrates breakdown within a short time window, and the meal is logged.
2. Given I opened the Mini App from the bot, When I view "Today", Then I see a list of my logged meals (time, photo thumbnail, calories, macros) and a running total for the day.
3. Given an estimate may not be perfect, When I open the logged meal in the Mini App, Then I can adjust the calories/macros and save corrections, updating my totals.
4. Given I want to track trends, When I view "Week" or "Month" in the Mini App, Then I see totals, averages, and charts for calories and macronutrients.
5. Given I accidentally logged a meal, When I choose to delete it in the Mini App, Then it is removed and daily/weekly totals are updated.
6. Given I have dietary targets, When I set a daily calorie goal, Then daily progress indicators reflect consumed vs target and remaining for the day.

### Edge Cases
- Blurry or low-light photo: The bot reply explains uncertainty and suggests retaking or editing in the Mini App.
- Multiple dishes or complex mixed meals: The reply communicates a single combined estimate, with a path to refine in the Mini App.
- Unsupported media (video, sticker) or no image: The bot asks for a food photo and offers help.
- Very large image: The bot requests a smaller image and explains limits.
- Duplicate submissions (same photo shortly after): The system detects likely duplicates and asks if the user wants to log again.
- Network or service issues: The bot informs the user that processing is delayed and will update when ready; the Mini App reflects pending status.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The bot MUST accept food photos sent by a user in chat and respond with an estimated total calories and macronutrient breakdown.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST log each analyzed meal with timestamp, user reference, estimated calories, and macronutrients.
- **FR-003**: The Mini App MUST present a daily list of logged meals with totals and allow users to view details for each entry.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to correct estimates (calories and/or macronutrients) in the Mini App and save updates to their logs.
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to delete a logged meal; totals MUST update accordingly.
- **FR-006**: The Mini App MUST provide weekly and monthly summaries, including totals and trend visualizations.
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to set a daily calorie target and see progress toward that target throughout the day.
- **FR-008**: The bot reply MUST be concise and friendly, emphasizing a minimal experience (photo in ‚Üí nutrition out), and provide a way to open the Mini App for details.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST maintain a history of meals so users can review prior days and periods.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST handle ambiguous or low-confidence cases by clearly communicating uncertainty and offering manual correction in the Mini App.
- **FR-011**: The design MUST be modern, mobile-first, and responsive to a variety of phone screen sizes.
- **FR-012**: The feature MUST respect user privacy and avoid exposing personal data in messages or screens beyond what is necessary for the experience.
- **FR-013**: The experience SHOULD align with community Mini App templates for consistency and familiarity.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST prevent accidental duplicate logging caused by repeated submissions of the same photo within a short interval.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST provide clear error messages and recovery guidance for unsupported content and transient failures.
- **FR-016**: The system SHOULD provide a "Share" option to promote the app; data export is not required at this time.
- **FR-017**: The system MUST support English and Russian at launch.
- **FR-018**: The system SHOULD provide disclaimers about estimate accuracy and encourage verification for medical use cases.

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **User**: Represents an individual Telegram user who interacts with the bot and Mini App; identified by a stable, privacy-respecting identifier.
- **Food Photo**: An image submitted by a user to be analyzed; associated with submission time and basic metadata.
- **Estimation**: A nutrition estimate derived from a food photo; includes total calories, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and a confidence indicator.
- **Meal Log**: A persisted record that references a user, a photo (or manual entry), the estimation (original and corrected), and timestamps.
- **Daily Summary**: Aggregated totals for a user on a specific date; used to present daily progress and comparisons to targets.
- **Goal**: A user-defined daily calorie target (and potential macro targets) applied to progress calculations.
